Preprocessor & Lexer

Preprocessor:
-Reads through file and replaces preprocessor directives with the corresponding code. The preprocessor waits for the lexer to input the
correct code into the stream.

Lexer:
-Lexes file into tokens, if it encounters a comment it skips over it, and if it finds a preprocessor directive, it waits for
the preprocessor to input the correct code into the stream.

Now we don't need to have the lex function calling the preprocessor function, they wait for eachother
