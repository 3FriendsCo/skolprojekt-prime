# Prime Programming Language

Prime is a new programming language inspired by the simplicity of Python, combined with the complexity and advanced features of C++ and Rust. The language is primarily written in C++, with some parts implemented in C, aiming to provide a powerful yet easy-to-use programming experience.

## Documentation

The documentation for the Prime programming language can be found on our GitHub page: [https://github.com/3FriendsCo/primeLang](https://https://github.com/3FriendsCo/primeLang).

## VSCode Extension

We have also created a Visual Studio Code extension for Prime, making it easier to write and debug Prime code within the popular code editor. The GitHub page for the VSCode extension is available here: [https://github.com/3FriendsCo/Prime-Extension](https://https://github.com/3FriendsCo/Prime-Extension).

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to add support for LLVM, JSON, and Ruby. Additionally, we aim to make Prime a versatile language by allowing users to write code in different programming languages within Prime itself.

Join us on our journey to make Prime a powerful and user-friendly programming language!
